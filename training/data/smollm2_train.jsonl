Gripping weights can be challenging with arthritis, but there are excellent alternatives. Resistance bands with loops don't require tight grip - just slip your hands through. Ankle weights let you train your legs without holding anything. Wrist weights work similarly for arms. For pushing exercises, use your palms flat against walls rather than gripping.
