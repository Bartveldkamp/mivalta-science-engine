Let me explain how this works.\n\nBase phase builds your aerobic foundation. Most of your training stays easy\u2014over 78 percent in the lower zones. This might feel slow, but it's where endurance is actually built. The adaptations happening in your mitochondria, capillaries, and connective tissue take time and easy effort.\n\nBuild phase adds race-specific work. More threshold training, more VO2max intervals. You start feeling genuinely race-fit during this phase. The foundation you built in base now supports harder efforts.\n\nPeak phase sharpens everything for race day. The quality of your intensity work reaches its highest point, but overall volume starts dropping. You're honing what you've built, not building more.\n\nTaper is final preparation. Volume drops dramatically\u201440 to 60 percent\u2014but intensity stays high. This is counterintuitive, but it's how performance is actually realized. Your body finally gets to express the fitness you've been building.\n\nHere's the key insight: we plan backwards from your race day. Your goal date is fixed and immovable.
