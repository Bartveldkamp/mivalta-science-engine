Increase duration or density instead. Week one might be three 8-minute threshold intervals. Week two adds a rep for four 8-minute intervals. Week three extends to four 10-minute intervals. Week four deloads back to three 8-minute. Your threshold pace stays constant, but you can hold it longer.

After pure recovery days, you don't really need a formal cooldown.\n\nWe calculate your ideal warmup and cooldown automatically based on your profile.

Let me share what the current evidence actually shows, because it's different from what many people expect.\n\nWeight loss is not endless slow cardio grinding in the so-called fat-burning zone. What actually works is consistency and frequency\u2014showing up matters most. Time-efficient HIIT touches at Zone 4 and Zone 5 can help, but they're not magic. Protecting your muscle with some strength work matters. And critically, avoiding the \"always hard but not hard enough\" trap where you spend too much time in Zone 3 grinding without real recovery.\n\nWhat doesn't work: hours of moderate-intensity slog, excessive intensity that tanks your recovery, or any program you can't actually stick with.\n\nOur approach combines a strong aerobic base with small HIIT touches and prioritizes weekly repeatability. If HIIT sessions hurt your adherence, they fail. The best program is the one you'll actually do."}]}

Outdated zones lead to wrong training\u2014zones set too high mean you can't hit targets and feel constantly overtrained; zones set too low mean training is too easy and you won't progress.\n\nHeart rate is unreliable for Zone 6 through Zone 8. The efforts are too short for heart rate to respond meaningfully. Use power, pace, or perceived effort for those hard intervals.\n\nIf you're newer to training, focus on perceived effort and the talk test first. Add heart rate and power monitoring as you learn how your body responds."}]}

Day 4 might withdraw 30 minutes from your threshold wallet for a proper threshold session. Day 8 takes 15 minutes from VO2max for intervals. Day 12 hits threshold again. All the other days spend from your Zone 2 wallet with base sessions.\n\nWhen a wallet is empty, you're done with that zone until the next mesocycle.

Your glycolytic and neuromuscular systems need that time to rebuild.\n\nBut here's what changes everything: hard to easy only needs 12 to 24 hours.

This is the two-lane model\u2014intensity blocks more intensity, but it doesn't block easy aerobic work.\n\nThis is why you can train five or six days per week.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does this work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A few things to keep in mind for safe, effective cycling training. Your power zones are only as good as your FTP measurement. Test every six to eight weeks\u2014fitness changes, and your zones need to reflect that. If you can't hit Zone 4 targets, your FTP is probably set too high. If Zone 4 feels surprisingly easy, it's too low.\n\nPower tells you how hard you're pushing, but it doesn't tell you if you're ready to push. You still need HRV, perceived effort, and sleep quality to guide your decisions. A tired body produces lower power, but the real danger is ignoring that fatigue and digging deeper anyway.\n\nFor indoor sessions, heat management isn't optional. Overheating tanks your power output and slows recovery afterward. Calibrate your power meter before important sessions\u2014a few percentage points of drift can throw off your entire workout.\n\nAnd here's an obvious one that people forget: no interval sessions in traffic. Save the hard efforts for safe roads or take them indoors. Intensity requires focus, and focus means not watching for cars.\n\nIf you're newer to structured training, the intensity zones unlock progressively\u2014same gates as running. Build your foundation first."}]}
